Analysis on NOW-data provided as pdf by UWV.
The conversion from pdf -> csv is done by Barry (https://github.com/barryharmsen/register-now-csv). Many thanks for that Barry.

The data is (partly) joined by data from CBS, in order to have a lookup plaats->gemeente->provincie->landsdeel.
See https://opendata.cbs.nl/#/CBS/nl/dataset/84734NED/table for the relevant data.
